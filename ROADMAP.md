## Implementation Strategy

### Code Organization
- **Modular Architecture**: Maintain clear separation between modules (brain, vision, ui, utils, data_processing, dataset_versioning, neural_network)
- **Configuration Management**: Keep all adjustable parameters in config.js
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error catching and recovery
- **Documentation**: Add detailed comments for all functions and classes

### Development Approach
1. **Incremental Development**: Complete one component at a time
2. **Test-Driven**: Create tests before implementing features
3. **Performance-Focused**: Continuously monitor and optimize performance
4. **User-Centric**: Prioritize ease of use and configuration

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing**: Test individual functions and methods
- **Integration Testing**: Verify module interactions
- **Performance Testing**: Measure CPU, memory, and battery usage
- **Stability Testing**: Run extended sessions to identify memory leaks or crashes

## Technical Considerations

### OpenAutoJS Capabilities
- Utilize built-in UI automation features
- Leverage image recognition capabilities
- Use file operations for data storage
- Implement threading for performance

### MEmu Emulator Optimization
- Configure optimal resolution and DPI
- Set appropriate CPU and memory allocation
- Implement emulator-specific optimizations
- Handle emulator restarts and crashes

## Success Metrics
